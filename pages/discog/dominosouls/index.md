teaser: "My fourth album, written aged sixteen. Some real cheese on this one, but 'Miracle' and 'Jane Doe' and 'Disaster Girl' are all pretty cool in my adult eyes. Jane Doe is probably the weirdest song I've ever written, and it's about a phorensic pathologist who falls in love at first sight with the dead girl on his slab, before having to cut her up. Yep, in retrospect, I probably needed some serious therapy. Enjoy!!!"
