title: Red Light Return - Seasons E.P.
subheadline: "2012"
teaser: "I met Ciaron & Adam at the beginning of a very beautiful journey with an incredible band. The video below is from the launch of my brother's record label 'Long Haired Music', and I think I mixed this track too. I was co-hosting the L4 Open Mic night at the time, they were studying at the uni and brought their talents to the stage. I offered to record their catchy songs, and this little E.P. was born. Later to be joined by Dan and Xak on drums, I was in this band for a couple of gigs. Really miss these guys! All the love in the world to you all, wherever you are now x"
