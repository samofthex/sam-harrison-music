title: Forbidden Fruit
subheadline: "2007"
teaser: "'Forbidden Fruit was my teenage white album. Aged 17 I wrote 28 songs, some of them... erm... weird and wonderful. There's also 'Fruit Bones' which is meant to be the highlights, but misses out some stuff that in retrospect was great. 'Date With My Creator' is a particular fave of mine, which I made a video to years later. 'The Serpant' is really special too, feels like the Smiths. 'Brain Drain' was my attempt at Motown. I was still a child, and in some of these it does show, but I hope you can find the beauty in them Xxx'"
