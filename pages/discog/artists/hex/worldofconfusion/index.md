title: Hex - World of Confusion
subheadline: "2004"
teaser: "Chunk and Perry must have come to the studio in 2004, because I didn't have Cubase yet. We made the Hex album with some very lo-fi gear, but the humour and catchy, clever lyrics of the Hex songs mean thaat they still make me chuckle. Me and Chunk used to sit together in the 'science four' table in science class, talk, and generally do little work. The best of times :)"
