title: James Sherrard - Hometaping Album.
subheadline: "2010"
teaser: "Hometaping is a super cool competition where musicians have to make an album in the month of October. It has to be at least 20 minutes long. James' computer broke, and we had one day of October, so I suggested he come over to my home studio and make his 1 month album in 1 day. I would do the same and submit my work that month too! We would hometape together. For a one day project, I think we did pretty good :) Check it out! x"
