subheadline: "2004"
teaser: "'My first album, aged 13. I found a magical device in the window of 'The Secret Music Shop' - a 4-track tape recorder. I knew what it was from pictures in guitar magazines, a Tascam Portastudio would mean I could multi-track myself playing lots of instruments one on top of another. I could make my own record label! I pestered my Mum and Dad for it for christmas. It was an old 1980's machine, with all the bells and whistles, and it worked magically well (when it didn't eat the tape). Within a year I'd made an album, and began a cottage industry of making albums and selling them to relatives who couldn't escape. It cost me £1 to make a copy, and I sold them for £5. well, I was hooked. As for listening value, it sounds pretty terrible - but it's kind of cute and good for a laugh. More importantly for me, it's part of my history, and it makes me happy to share these memories :)'"
