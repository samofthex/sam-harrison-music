So, who the heck is Sam Harrison?
Here we will begin to answer this complex and disturbing question.
Sam's reputation as a different, maverick songwriter has been cemented by his debut album 'Yes Hard Feelings' and two follow up E.P.s 'Aurora' and 'The Wish'. He spent four years and made four albums with DIY acoustic punk outfit 'The Breakfast Club' as a drummer, guitarist, producer and singer. In 2015 he formed his own band 'the Society of Strange Living'. While cutting his teeth as a solo entertainer on cruise ships, Sam lives a split life of international travel, gigging and recording. His exploits include playing the 2012 Olympics, the Edinburgh Fringe and Glastonbury festival (naked). His parchant for the unusual is reflected in his band's name, which implies his highly unauthadox lifestyle and unruly reputation.
