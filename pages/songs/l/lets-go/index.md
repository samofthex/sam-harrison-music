LET'S GO:<br>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YgszUsuD19A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
I’ve been working hard<br>
I’ve travelled many miles<br>
I earned a lot of money<br>
But it didn’t make me smile<br>
Barclay’s and Lloyds<br>
And HSBC<br>
All the money in the world<br>
And you wont catch me<br>
<br>
I’m going where there’s no phone signal and no facebook<br>
There’ll be no McDonalds and I won’t give a fuck<br>
There’ll be deep clean rivers and sweet fresh air<br>
And if you climb up on my back then I will take you there<br>
<br>
The wind up in the trees<br>
Will ease your troubled brain<br>
And the water on my skin<br>
Will wash away my pain<br>
We wont need our clothes<br>
And we won’t need our phones<br>
We’ll curl up in the night<br>
And warm each others bones<br>
<br>
I’m going where there’s no phone signal and no facebook<br>
There’ll be no McDonalds and I won’t give a fuck<br>
There’ll be deep clean rivers and sweet fresh air<br>
And if you climb up on my back then I will take you there<br>
<br>
Twitter will survive<br>
Without you and me<br>
There’s plenty more hatefish<br>
In the hashtag sea<br>
Facebook wont miss us<br>
When it shares more lies<br>
We’ll get our notification<br>
From our mouths and eyes<br>
<br>
I’m going where there’s no phone signal and no facebook<br>
There’ll be no McDonalds and I won’t give a fuck<br>
There’ll be deep clean rivers and sweet fresh air<br>
And if you climb up on my back then I will take you there<br>
<br>
Donald J Trump<br>
Will loose his appeal<br>
And Theresa May<br>
Will go back to her wheatfield<br>
Still we won’t go back<br>
When our friends hear our song<br>
They’ll pack all their bags<br>
And then they’ll come along<br>
<br>
There’ll be no more Tescos<br>
And no Starbucks<br>
There’ll be no Daily Mail<br>
And I wont give a fuck<br>
There’ll be deep clean rivers and sweet fresh air<br>
And if you climb up in my Kombi I will take you there<br>
