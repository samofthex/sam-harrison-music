LIFE'S KILLS:<br>

Congratulations here’s your badge<br>
My boy you’ve reached 18 at last<br>
It’s time to grow up, quick get wise<br>
And see the world through weary eyes<br>
We’ll help you burn your childhood toys<br>
We’ll pay for you to learn to drive<br>
Off to university<br>
Find a girl raise a family<br><br>
Please tell me why d’ya look so sad?<br>
Don’t you understand your on your own at last<br>
Don’t be unhappy baby here dry your eyes<br>
You’ll have to learn till your on your own to cry<br><br>
We’ll teach you how the world revolves<br>
And start you off on stacking shelves<br>
You’ll learn to beat the next man down<br>
To poach his job and steal his crown<br>
Steer clear of easy blondes<br>
And cigarettes will wreck your lungs<br>
That’s six more days of life you’ve wasted<br>
Out with the boys your getting plastered<br><br>
Please tell me why d’ya look so sad?<br>
Don’t you understand your on your own at last<br>
Don’t be unhappy baby here dry your eyes<br>
You’ll have to learn till your on your own to cry<br><br>
I don’t want university<br>
It only means more misery<br>
It might affect what I can earn<br>
But  you can’t teach what I want to learn<br>
Stick or  twist I guess the way<br>
In a game I never asked to play<br>
I can’t abide your plan for me<br>
I have to do things differently<br>
Please tell me why you look so hurt -<br>
Are my hands in my pockets when you want them up your skirt?<br>
It’s nothing in particular, it’s everything you’ve said<br>
This book hasn’t been written<br>
But it’s all here in my head<br><br>
You wonder why I never speak<br>
Unless my words are tongue in cheek<br>
To tell the truth I live in fear<br>
Of the poison you dropped in my ear<br>
So lets say that I follow your plan<br>
Become a grade A plastic man<br>
One day I’ll grow old and die<br>
Hating myself and wondering why<br><br><br>
