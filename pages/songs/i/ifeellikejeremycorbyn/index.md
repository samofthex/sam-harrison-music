I eat my sandwiches on the train<br>
and I feel like Jeremy Corbyn<br>
I ride my bicycle in the rain<br>
and I feel like Jeremy Corbyn<br>

I’m sick of politician who have never worked a day in their lives<br>
Changing their opinions with the turning of the tides<br>
I believe in Kier Hardie<br>
I believe in Clem Attlee<br>
I believe in society<br>
And I want to be like Jeremy<br>

I march in the CND parade<br>
and I feel like Jeremy Corbyn<br>
I buy my groceries from Fairtrade<br>
and I feel like Jeremy Corbyn<br><br>

I’d rather put my faith behind a socialist solution<br>
Than some self entitled millionaire who bought his place at Eton<br>
I believe in public healthcare<br>
I believe in state welfare<br>
I’m sick of first world poverty<br>
And I think I’m gonna vote for Jeremy<br>
Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy C<br><br>

(Solo)<br>
<br>
Saturday night with my cat & my beans<br>
and I feel like Jeremy Corbyn<br>
My girlfriend tells me that I’ve got a big mandate<br>
and I feel like Jeremy Corbyn<br>
<br>
I believe in single mothers<br>
I believe in Wooly jumpers<br>
John McDonnell is really quite pleasing<br>
I like his people’s quantitate easing<br>
Quantitate easing, quantitate easing, quantitate easing, quantitate easing<br><br>

I stand up for what I believe in<br>
and I feel like Jeremy Corbyn<br>
I stand up for what I believe in<br>
and I feel like Jeremy Corbyn<br>
Jez we can!<br>
