HOMELESS:<br>
  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FiDCCZSJwEc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
Can you spare a little change?<br>
Cause underneath this blanket is a human<br>
Can you spare a little change?<br>
Can you see me?<br>
Could you need me?<br>
Cause god I need you now<br><br>

If you looked into my eyes<br>
Could you ever meet me as an equal<br>
If I unraveled my life<br>
Could you trust me?<br>
Could you hold me?<br>
Cause god I need you now<br>
<br>
We are the children of the dust<br>
And we know you<br>
And we feel you<br>
But still you walk on by<br>
We are the children of the dust<br>
And we’re fading<br>
And we’re breaking<br>
And this cold will dull our shine<br>
On this piercing wretched night<br>
This cold will dull my shine<br>
<br>
If I took off all my clothes<br>
Could you ever see me as a person?<br>
Shrivelled skin and shrunken bones<br>
Would me tears<br>
Speak my years?<br>
Could you ever grant me a home?<br>
<br>
Could I ever start again?<br>
Cause I’m thinner and I’m feinter than an angel<br>
I can barely move my hands<br>
My mistake’s<br>
Rolling snakes<br>
Would I scare you if I called you my friend?<br>
<br>
We are the children of the dust...<br>
<br>
On this piercing wretched night<br>
This cold will kill my light<br>
