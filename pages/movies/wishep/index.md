 HISTORY:
Sam was so proud of his first vinyl release, 'The Wish' EP, he decided to throw the best party he could possibly create to showcase the EP, some of his own music, and some of his brilliantly talented friends. The 'Lizard Party', featured a vinyl DJ, free candy for everyone, unexpected hidden prizes, free facepaint and a suprise camera crew.
 
He found the Red Wave group filming at the Jolly Brewer Open Mic, studying at Lincoln university he invited them to come and film the gig in multi-cam, and he would record the audio in multi-track, and mix it later on. They did an incredible job, as you can see from the end product!

<a href="https://youtu.be/JK2jhnZVMZI">THE MARMALADIES</a> - The fantastic songwriting skills of Lauren Davies & Hannah Mook start off the night with their original song 'Cover' (punderful) with beautiful harmony backing from Hannah against Lauren's rich lead vocal. It set the high standard for the whole night.<br>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/laurenrycroftmusician/">LAUREN & CALLUM</a> - Lauren & Callum's talents perfectly compliment each other as they rip through two perfect covers of contempary pop, absolutely blowing the roof of as always. Lauren is still making music, and has just released her debut single <a href="https://youtu.be/odbiqkA2-lQ">'Paint the Skies'</a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/laurenrycrofusician/">EXPERIMENTAL SONIC MACHINES</a> - The music of Mr Peter Rollings is completely unique - partly because of his unique personality and delivery, partly because of incredible home made musical instruments! He also makes wonderful, unique artwork, with a psychadelic theme - on display at Lincoln's 10 Decimal Place. The people of Lincoln love Experimental Sonic Machines, but professional reptile Simon Cowell didn't seem to appreciate them quite as much as we do. On Pete's Britain's Got Talent audition he's treated not so nicely by Mr Cowell and his team - in fact they were incredibly rude. But don't worry! You can see Pete's incredible performance art here, with music better sound and visual than the tele. I love Pete's music, and I'd one million times rather work with him than Mr Cowell. Do you feel the same? x
