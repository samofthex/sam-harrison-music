 HISTORY:
Sam was so proud of his first vinyl release, 'The Wish' EP, he decided to throw the best party he could possibly create to showcase the EP, some of his own music, and some of his brilliantly talented friends. The 'Lizard Party', featured a vinyl DJ, free candy for everyone, unexpected hidden prizes, free facepaint and a suprise camera crew.
 
He found the Red Wave group filming at the Jolly Brewer Open Mic, studying at Lincoln university he invited them to come and film the gig in multi-cam, and he would record the audio in multi-track, and mix it later on. They did an incredible job, as you can see from the end product!

It set the high standard for the whole night.<br>
